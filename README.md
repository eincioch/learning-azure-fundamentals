  > The world rewards specialization but it cames a cost: you learn more and more about less and less until you know everything about nothing.

  > I am studying for the AZ900 Microsoft Certification Azure Fundamentals Exam. Here is the study path that I designed and I am following :)


## Recommendations
```
Some recommendations that work for me:
  - I googled "Azure Fundamentals Certification". My first result was the certification site which has severals resources, so I started here. 
  - I checked a learning path, which is detailed below and that recommends to study the concepts in this order: cloud concepts, Azure services, security terms and Azure costs and support.
  - I created a plan to study each set of concepts during a month dedicating a week for each one.
  - I read the requirements, rules, times, numbers of questions related to the exam! I didn't want to lose the exam for not being on time.
  - I took notes of key terms and concepts. In most cases, the names have a relation with the objective of the service. So using my background and logic I solved some questions!
  - I took notes of little details that I considered important or hard to remember. In this way, when I was learning, I could go back and I had a chance to remember the notes with just a quick look.
  - I completed the course - Azure Fundamentals. It is free and it takes 10 hours.
  - I tried some Azure Fundamentals sample questions.
  - I read about the pricing model, conditions of service support and the available regions.
  - I tried the simulation tests in [Whizlabs], [Udemy] y [O'reilly]. They are paid, but free trial versions work well.
  - I am going to attend the online exam, so I will tell you how it goes!
